## Ghostty

The font is using [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font).

## zsh

The prompt is using [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

And there are three zsh extensions I use:

1. **zoxide**: a smarter cd command.
   
   ```bash
   brew install zoxide
   ```

2. **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: highlight the command.
   
   ```bash
   brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
   ```

3. **zsh-autosuggestions**: suggests commands as you type.
   
   ```bash
   brew install zsh-autosuggestions
   ```

4. **fzf**: command-line fuzzy finder.
   
   ```bash
   brew install fzf
   ```

5. **eza**: modern alternative to ls.
   
   ```bash
   brew install eza
   ```
